=========== Instructions for Vulcan ==========================

STEP 1: Install dependencies using the install script.
STEP 2: Compile Vulcan code.
STEP 3: Run Vulcan code using log data.
STEP 4: Collect sensor data on Vulcan

===================================================================================

STEP 1: Install dependecies using the install scripts.

From the root directory, just run;

./install.sh

This script will install all required packages via apt-get and by installing other
dependencies contained in the external folder.

===================================================================================

STEP 2: Compile Vulcan code.

1) To compile the code, type in the Vulcan root directory:

        scons (scons -c for cleaning, scons -jx with x=number of jobs)

2) To view the code documentation, type in ./src

        doxygen

   Open the documentation from ./docs/doxygen/html/index.html.

===================================================================================
STEP 3: Run Vulcan offline

1) Download log data:
  The complete repository of logs is located in /data/vulcan/logs. While some cleanup has been done, many logs
  are archaic and don't work with the current system. Recommended logs for trying things out are in the 'reference'
  folder. 'bbb3_turn_in_place.log' and 'eecs3.log' both work well. In general anything from 2015 onwards should be
  fine, as the hardware and low-level software matured by then.

2) Run log data:

        lcm-logplayer-gui <log data file name>

3) Start the modules you want to run, the logs replace the sensors, so no sensors need to be connected.
    All compiled modules are installed in the build/bin directory. Default arguments are sufficient to get started.

    To test everything, try running:
        - local_metric_hssh
        - state_estimator
        - debug_ui

    Start the logplayer. In the Local Metric tab of the DebugUI, you'll see the robot driving around building an LPM
    of the environment.

===================================================================================
STEP 4: Collect sensor data on Vulcan

1) Turn on the sensors (on the wheelchair)
2) Plug the sensors into the laptop.
3) Start reading the sensor data, start the debug UI, and start the modules

        ./start_all_sensors
        ./start_debug_ui
        (Most modules can be found in build/bin/.)

        If you need camera (you probably don't!):
        ./start_vulcan_camera (if you need to use the camera)

4) Switch to robot mode for autonomous navigation
5) Log data using

        ./log_sensor_data

6) When finished, close all sensor reading terminals (Ctrl+C)
7) Switch to human mode if in robot mode
8) Unplug the sensors from the laptop.
9) Turn off the sensors.
(IMPORTANT: Always unplug sensors from the laptop first and then turn them off, to prevent power surge)


===================================================================================
LCM-SPY JAVA INTEGRATION

The build process produces a jar file containing the Java classes for the LCM messages. Including
this jar file allows for introspection on the messages received by lcm-spy. The viewable messages
will be any messages with real LCM types, as opposed to the generic binary buffer type. These
complete types include all sensor messages and any messages involved in the high-level VADE
architecture.

To use this jar file:

1) Build the code as normal via scons.
2) Run from the root directory in a terminal:
    source setenv.sh
3) Run lcm-spy from this terminal.

You should now see that some types of messages have been detected and have names as opposed to raw
ids. Click on these messages and you'll be able to see the raw content!


===============================================================
DEPENDENCIES

The following dependencies are automatically installed by the install script, but they are listed here in case you need
to manually correct problems:

Via Apt:

git                    (version control system)

libwxgtk-media3.0-dev  (GUI for Vulcan)
libf2c2-dev            (required by levmar)
openjdk-8-jdk          (required by lcm gui, any version 6 or higher works)
libusb-dev             (required by libphidget)
libusb-1.0-0-dev       (required by libphidget)
libpopt-dev            (required by peak-linux-driver, cmdline parsing)
libsdl1.2-dev          (required by URG C++ libraries)
libsdl-net1.2-dev      (required by URG C++ libraries)
libopencv-dev          (OpenCV libraries)
cmake                  (for building external libraries)
autoconf               (for building LCM)


External libraries:

* levmar-2.6 (http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/)    (or the newest version.)

        make
        sudo cp liblevmar.a /usr/local/lib
        sudo cp levmar.h /usr/local/include

* lcm (https://github.com/lcm-proj/lcm/releases) (newest version)

        ./configure
        (Make sure Java is found; If not, do "sudo apt-get install openjdk-6/7/8-jdk" and then ./configure again.)
        make
        sudo make install

        >>>>  Copy src/cpp/urg/ScipHandler.h to /usr/local/include/urg/    this is used for calculating timing information and isn't installed by default.

        Note: Vulcan needs both C and C++ libraries. If C++ libraries does not compile make sure libsdl1.2-dev and libsdl-net1.2-dev are installed.
